# The Impact of Class and Gender on Titanic Survival

## Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the Titanic disaster, focusing on the impact of class and gender on survival rates. Using Power BI, I have created an interactive dashboard that provides insights into how these factors influenced the outcomes of this historical event.

## Key Features

- **Survival Analysis by Class**: Explore how the different passenger classes (First, Second, Third) affected survival rates.
- **Gender-Based Survival Rates**: Analyze the influence of gender on the likelihood of survival.
- **Demographic Comparisons**: Compare the survival rates across various demographics, providing a comprehensive view of the passengers' fates.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with dynamic charts and graphs that make the data easy to understand and explore.

## Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard is designed to help users explore the data in an intuitive way. You can filter by class, gender, and other variables to see how these factors interacted to determine survival outcomes.

## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes detailed information about the passengers on board.


## Conclusion

This project highlights the power of data visualization in uncovering insights from historical events. By analyzing the impact of class and gender on Titanic survival rates, we can better understand the societal dynamics of the early 20th century.
